It packages your application and infrastructure together, managed as one component. These images are then used to create Docker containers which run on the container virtualization platform, provided by Docker. These images can be distributed using Docker Registry. Kubernetes provides an open source orchestration of Docker containers.\n\nThis talk will provide an introduction to Docker images (build time), containers (run time), and registry (distribution). Java EE application require operating system, JDK, database, application server, tuning of different parts of the stack, WAR file, and much more. The talk will explain how to create and publish Docker images that package these components and talk to each other. Design patterns and anti-patterns that show how to create cluster of such applications will be shown. Replicating your development, test, and production environments using Docker images will be shown. Basic terminology of Kubernetes will be introduced. Attendees will learn how Kubernetes’s self-healing mechanism can be used to create cluster of these containers.",
