You likely need to talk to secured services, you need to lock down parts of your app and you need to maintain good application structure to name a few things. In this workshop we’ll build an enterprise Angular app from start to finish in TypeScript and secure sections of the app using Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. Well see how we can access a user’s mailbox to use their email, contacts and calendar that resides in Office 365. We’ll store files within the user’s OneDrive files. You’ll see how to store collaborative data within lists in Office 365. We’ll do all this using WebStorm, but you can use any text editor. You don’t have to have any experience with Office 365 APIs or Azure AD to participate in this workshop… you’ll learn how to do all of it!</p>\n\n<p>Pre-Requirements: To participate in building the application demonstrated in the workshop, you will need an Office 365 tenant as well as a Microsoft Azure subscription to build this application… you can create trials for these quickly, but you should do it ahead of time.</p>",

Now with a new set of new W3C web platform primitives called Web Components, we can encapsulate UI and complex functionalities, just like packing data and functions into a single component, and restrict the access in object-oriented programming.\nThe web components don’t add ugly children in your DOM tree, in fact, they are separated from the tree. The DOM-related methods like getElementById() doesn’t give you an access inside!\n\nSo, how can you use the encapsulated components and also obtain the access inside and style them?",

Google Cast allows you to share content with a Google Cast receiver device, such as a Chromecast. Google Cast web senders use the familiar controls of your desktop browser to control the experience of your application on the big screen. In this talk, Google Developer Advocate Kevin Nilson will talk about Chrome Sender App Development and HTML5/JavaScript Receiver Development. Kevin will also cover some of the best practices to keep your Cast experience simple, intuitive, and predictable.",
